# Ingrid Front-end Coding Assignment

This is a small coding assignment to assess a candidate's skill regarding front-end development.

### Description

We need to build a small web based currency converter that can answer these questions:
What is 200 SEK converted into multiple other currencies like USD, GBP and SGD?  
How much has currency changed in valuation between March 26th, 2015 and June 13th, 2017?  
To answer those, you can use exchangeratesapi.io to get your currencies data. We would also like to see the web app persist state on page reload.

### Technology stack

- React
- Any third party packages or frameworks you want to use.

### Requirements

We should be able to run the code on our computers. Hint: A good README.txt goes a long way.

### What will we look at

- Your ability to write code that is easy to follow, understand and extend
  - Show off your skills but remember that above all, we value code that's simple
- Your ability to create good looking UIs with user interaction in mind
  - We want to see you can create something nice without detailed mockups. External UI libraries are fine too
- Your ability to translate requirements into working implementation
- Your ability to document and explain non-coding requirements if there are any
- Your ability to secure code maintainability

### Last notes

We use this task to understand your coding style and how you approach problems.  
We know it can take a few hours to finish and perfecting it could eat your whole day.  
Therefore we encourage you to write as many comments as you can. If you're aware your solution is missing something you didn't have time to finish, let us know - write a comment, add pseudo code.  
The more you tell us, the easier it will be to understand what you were trying to do.
Don't forget to show us what you're really good at. Whether that's UI work, animations, code structure, performance optimization, give us a taste of your best skills.  
Good luck!
